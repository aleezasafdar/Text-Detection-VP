1:Performance Requirements
 The performance requirements, as the name suggests, refers to the performance of the
system i.e. how effectively and efficiently the system does the tasks for which it was designed
for.These include for example the speed of processing,memory utilization efficiency etc.
Performance requirements are one most vital aspects of an SRS document so these require
special consideration. Some examples of performance requirement are:

> For instance we want to create a system to be able to compare the specifications of 
  different smartphones. A performance requirement would be that up to 5 different
  smartphones specifications should be displayed within 30 milliseconds.
> Suppose we want to create a network for data sharing between users. A performance 
  requirement would be that upto 150 users can send and receive data without the
  server slowing down.
> Suppose we want to create software to handle orders in restaurant. The software
  should be able to handle 3 orders at a time without error
